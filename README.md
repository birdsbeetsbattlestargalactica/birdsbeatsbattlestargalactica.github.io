Welcome to the project site for Adina & James' bird classifier submission. This
gitbook serves as documentation for our participation in the Spring 2023 CSE 
455 bird classification competition hosted on [Kaggle][1].

### Dataset
  We were provided a training dataset consisting of 30 thousand bird images 
  divided into 535 separate classes. We were provided names for each class and 
  a .csv file mapping the training images to their classes.

  We were also provided a test dataset consisting of 10 thousand images. We 
  were not provided labels for the test dataset.

### Code
  We were provided starter code by our professor Joseph Redmon. You can see
  our complete code [here][2]. The changes we made will be highlighted in
  the experiment pages.  

This summary should mention the problem setup, data used, techniques, etc. It should include a description of which components were from preexisting work (i.e. code from github) and which components were implemented for the project (i.e. new code, gathered dataset, etc).
